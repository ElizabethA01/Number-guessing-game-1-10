This is a simple game of guessing a number between 1 and 10. 

To play, the game will ask you to 'Guess a number:'

Next, you input a number till you get the number. 

# My Thoughts
This was my earlier stages of learning Python and it felt very satisfying to see how quickly I was able to put this game together through coding. 
To challenge myself more, I created another random guessing game where you can input a lower and upper limit which you can check out here:
